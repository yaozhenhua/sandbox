# Using Secure Net Tcp Binding in WCF

This is a self-host console program which starts a simple WCF service. It uses net tcp binding with transport and
message security. A self-signed certificate is required to start the program on the dev machine.

Note this is for demonstration of legacy technologies only. Newly developed app should use protobuf over gRPC.
